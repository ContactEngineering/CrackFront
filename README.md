CrackFront 
===========

This code implements a linearized Crack-Front model for the mechanics of adhesive contacts in Python.
The model includes: 
- linear noncircular perturbation of the energy release rate with respect to the circular JKR solution.
- solving for the equilibrium position of the crack-front on a heterogeneous work of adhesion field. Following resolution algorithms are implemented:
  - a modified trust-region Newton-CG minimization algorithm 
  - the crack-propagation algorithm by Rosso and Krauth, that generates a monotonically increasing (or decreasing) sequence of crack positions 
- computation of the work of adhesion heterogeneity equivalent to surface roughness.


The crack-perturbation model for the adhesion of spheres with work of adhesion heterogeneity is described and validated against the boundary-element method in 
[Sanner, Pastewka, JMPS (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509622000059).

The crack-perturbation model for the adhesion of rough spheres is described and validated against the boundary-element method in

The crack perturbation method is based on the first-order perturbation of the stress intensity factor derived by Gao and Rice using weight-function theory.
